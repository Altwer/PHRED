# PHReD
Powerful Hacking Registry-enabled Device



This is implementation of raspberry pi computer with 3.5" tft lcd, esp8266 and Deauther firmware v3 from Spacehuhn. (https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/tree/v3)
There is also Huhnitor installed (https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/Huhnitor)
And raspbian OS lite (https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)


'coz lcd uses primary UART on gpio, I had to enable another one. (I choosed UART5, on gpio 12 and 13)
